# WabiLogic

![PersistPro Title](./pp-conceptwithicon_new2.png "Logo Title Text 1")

WabiLogic was a company my friend and I started together back in 2009. We built a backup solution named PersistPro. It supported encryption and tracking changes in files over time, backing up data to external storage, NFS, and FTP.

When we decided to disolve the company we release the source for anyone to use.

The code base has been slightly updated since then but the biggest issue today is how it used SqlServerCE. The DataSet objects that generated code are not supported out of the box
in visual studio anymore. 

This is here more as a curiosity at this point and a nice trip down memory lane for us.
